# First Draft Endings

## About This Project ðŸ““
All and all, _First Draft Endings_
is a project conceived by me, Cristian E. Caroli.

I follow a fixed set of rules:

- Each <i>FDE</i> has to end the story.
- A single page.
- No outside feedback before posting.
- No duplicates. Once a story gets a <i>FDE</i>, it won't get another one.
- No TV.
- A % of the script comes from the original.

All sits on top of a React App built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 
So thanks to Dan Abramov for that! 

Feel free to add support for any missing features you would like to see. :fire:
